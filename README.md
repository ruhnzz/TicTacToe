The TicTacToe game is a two-player game played on a nxn grid. The players take turns marking spaces on the grid with their respective symbols, usually 'X' and 'O', aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, col, diagonally or antidiagonally.

In the Java implementation, the game would typically start with an empty grid displayed to the players. Each player would then take turns inputting their moves by selecting a grid position where they want to place their symbol. The program would check if the move is valid (i.e., the selected grid position is empty) and update the grid accordingly.

The game continues until one player achieves three of their symbols in a row or if the grid is filled completely, resulting in a draw. The program would then announce the winner or declare a draw accordingly.
